The following analysis is originally based on the case study “‘Sophisticated, Clear, and Polished’: Divvy and Data Visualization” written by Kevin Hartman (found here: https://artscience.blog/home/divvy-dataviz-case-study). We will be using the Divvy dataset for the case study, as part of the Google Data Analytics Program. The data has been made publicly available by Motivate International Inc. under this license. 


The datasets can be collected from https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html
